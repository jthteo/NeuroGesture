# NeuroGesture using LeapMotion
### Alpha version 0.21; 30 March 2014

Designed by Dr James Teo, Dr Brigitta Zics 
This software is an Alpha version using the LeapJS in 2014 with dependencies from [node.js](https://github.com/nodejs) and [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).

Does not work on Gemini V5; Javascript support was deprecated by Ultraleap/Leapmotion in v5 with websockets only through the C, Unity API or Unreal API. :-(
